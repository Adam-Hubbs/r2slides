\title{Calculate Bounding Box for Slide Position Objects}
\usage{
bounding_box(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more slide_position objects}
}
\value{
A slide_position object representing the bounding box (with rotation = 0)
}
\description{
Returns the axis-aligned bounding box that contains one or more slide_position objects,
accounting for rotation.
}
\details{
When objects are rotated, their actual occupied space extends beyond their intrinsic
width and height. This function calculates the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that
contains all provided objects, including any rotation.

All objects must have the same slide_size (slide_width and slide_height).
