  # Create rest of json, add unpack_range() in the correct spot

  # Get current slide

  # Find spreadsheet_id, sheet_name, and chart_id from spreadsheet

  # Create json body for linked chart request
  # Pass to query2

  # return updated state of presentation 
  # Should we also update spreadsheet to chow that the chart_id is now linked?
  # Ideally, I think yes, but it could be tricky if users also do it by hand
